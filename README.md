# Flow-Free-Game
Java Swing and Java Applett environment

## 1. Introduction

In the flow free game there is  square grid. In the square grid at some places dots are placed. Each dots have the identical pair that is two dots have the same color. Then we have to connect this pair of dots with the help of the mouse. We have to drag the mouse starting from one of the dot and join to the another identical dot. And this two dots is connected with the help of the pipe or rectangle of same of dots.  In this way have to connect the all the dots present in the square grid. In this we will win if all the cells of the square grid is covered by the pipes.

## 2. Components used
We have built the game using  Java. Java provides many graphic classes such as java swing , java applet , mouse event listener, action listener etc. some of them is used by us in this project are listed below

•	Java swing
•	Java applets
•	Java awt event listener


## 3. Features of the game

When the game is played many exceptions are going to occurs so to encounter that type of the situations the game provides many features.
Some of that are mentioned below-

•	we try to overlap the two pipe or rectangle of same color or of other color then it will erase the previous pipe. 
•	This game has many levels from easy to hard. In easy level the distinct dots are less and also the number of cells in square grid is less. In hard level the number of distinct dots are more and also the number of cells in square grid are more.
•	When we try to connect the two different color dots then it won’t allow.
•	If we get stuck at some level and we want to start it again then reset button is also there to restart that level again.
•	At the end of the game if we successfully complete the level then will print “Well played, you win ” in console window.


This are the sailent features of the game that are provided to the user. Many of them are implemented by us in this game.
