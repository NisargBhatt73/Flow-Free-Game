# Flow-Free-Game
Java Swing and Java Applett environment

## 1. Introduction

In the flow free game there is  square grid. In the square grid at some places dots are placed. Each dots have the identical pair that is two dots have the same color. Then we have to connect this pair of dots with the help of the mouse. We have to drag the mouse starting from one of the dot and join to the another identical dot. And this two dots is connected with the help of the pipe or rectangle of same of dots.  In this way have to connect the all the dots present in the square grid. In this we will win if all the cells of the square grid is covered by the pipes.
